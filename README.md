## 📱 How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Start a chat with your bot on Telegram
2. Send `/start` or `/new` to begin
3. Choose your preferred mode:

### Manual Mode
1. **Get word suggestions** - Bot suggests 5 optimized words with probability scores
2. **Play the word** - Enter the suggested word in the actual Wordle game
3. **Provide feedback** - Send the color pattern using:
   - `g` = 🟩 (correct letter, correct position)
   - `y` = 🟨 (correct letter, wrong position)  
   - `b` = ⬛ (letter not in word)
   - Example: `gybgb` for 🟩🟨⬛🟩⬛

### Screenshot Mode
1. **Take a screenshot** of your Wordle game (dark mode recommended)
2. **Upload the image** to the bot
3. **Get instant analysis** - Bot reads all completed words and suggests next moves
4. **Continue playing** with filtered suggestions

### Example Conversation
```
Bot: 🎯 Pick a suggested word:
     SLATE (15.2%) | ARISE (14.8%) | ROATE (14.1%)

You: [Select SLATE]

Bot: How did 'SLATE' score in Wordle?
     Reply with: g=🟩 y=🟨 b=⬛
     Example: gybgb

You: byybb

Bot: 📊 Analysis: 12 possible words
     🎯 Next suggestions:
     CHOIR (23.4%) | DOUGH (21.2%) | PHONE (19.8%)
```
